Verb conjugation trainer for portuguese (BR)
============================================

This is a Preview of verb conjugation trainer for Brazilian portuguese.
It contains 73 most common verbs with conjugations in presente, pretérito perfeito and pretérito imperfeito (for imperfeito cards types are not written yet).
Goal is to cover the top 500 verbs.


**IMPORTANT** How to use

1. By default, only the cards for learning present tense are active, this is what you should start with.
Past tense is suspended (deactivated) by default. If you want to enable the past tens cards, do the following:
* open the Browser
* type in the search bar: `deck:{name-of-the-deck} card:7 or card:8 or card:9 or card:10 or card:11 or card:12`
    * alternative: if this is your only deck or you are sure you have no other supended card, you can go simply to the 'suspended' tab in the browser
* hit return
* now all the suspended cards should be visible (yellow background)
* mark all and click the suspend button to unsuspend them
2. In case you only want to practice irregular verbs, that's also possible. Just select and suspend all notes that have the field 'type' empty. You can do so by typing `type:` in the browser.
3. You can also suspend or unsuspend one verb at a time, if you like to so. I'll include an example here in the future.
4. If you want to use the spreadsheet in order to import it into Anki, you can do so. Make sure you convert the spreadsheet into a csv-file with utf8 encoding (e.g. with LibreOffice -> save a copy). Be aware to NOT USE the comma `,` as a seperator since the example sentences contain commas. Use semicolons `;` instead.
5. additional recommandations: in order to learn the most importand verbs first, go to the deck options, go to the 'new cards' tab and check whether the order is set to `show cards in order added` and uncheck `bury related new cards`.
