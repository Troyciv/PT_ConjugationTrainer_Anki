Anki Verb Conjugation Trainer For Portuguese (BR)
============================================

This is a portuguese verb conjugation trainer for [Anki](http://ankisrs.net). It is mainly designed for Brazilian Portuguese, but it's easy to set up for continetial portuguese as well (read on to learn more)
It contains the 1000 most common verbs in portuguese.
Out of the box you can practice presente and pretérito perfeito. To activate other tenses you need to unsuspend them (read on to learn how)

This deck contains ready-to-use cards for:
* Presente 
* Pretérito perfeito
* Pretérito imperfeito (deactivated by default)
* Futuro do presente (deactivated by default)
* Subjuntivo Presente (deactivated by default)
* Subjuntivo Pretérito Imperfeito (deactivated by default)
* Subjuntivo Futuro (deactivated by default)  

If you need other conjugations (such as Pretérito mais-que-perfeito or Fururo do pretérito), simply create the cards you like and reimport the csv file. You can open the csv file with your preferred spreadsheet application beforehand to see what's available and to check the correct mapping.

**For continetial portuguese** it is very similar. Create the missing cards for tu and vós, then reimport the csv file. Be careful about the correct mapping and use `update existing notes`.



### Usage

0. Import the deck into Anki

1. By default, only the cards for learning present tense and pretérito perfeito are active, this is what you should start with.
Other tenses are suspended (deactivated) by default. If you want to enable the pretérito imperfeito cards, do the following:
   * open the Browser
   * type in the search bar: `deck:{name-of-the-deck} card:13 or card:14 or card:15 or card:16 or card:17 or card:18` and hit return
      
       use this table for the other tenses:

      |    tense                        |    cards     |
      |    -----                        |    -----     |
      |    Futuro do Presente           | 19-24 |
      | Subjuntivo Presente             | 25-30 |
      | Subjuntivo Pretérito Imperfeito | 31-36 |
      | Subjuntivo Futuro               | 37-42 |

   * now all the suspended cards should be visible (yellow background)
   * mark all and click the suspend button to unsuspend them
2. In case you only want to practice irregular verbs, that's also possible. Just select and suspend all notes that have a 'R' (for regular) in the field 'type'. You can do so by typing `type:R` in the browser.
3. Repositioning: if you want to learn some verbs earlier than others, select the notes and use the reposion command in the browser. Take a look in the [manual](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#other-menu-items) for further information.
4. If you want to use the spreadsheet in order to import it into Anki, you can do so. Make sure you convert the spreadsheet into a csv-file with utf8 encoding (e.g. with LibreOffice -> save a copy). Be aware to NOT USE the comma as a seperator since the example sentences contain commas. Use semicolons `;` instead.
5. additional recommandations: in order to learn the most importand verbs first, go to the deck options, go to the 'new cards' tab and check whether the order is set to `show cards in order added` and uncheck `bury related new cards`.
